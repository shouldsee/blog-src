- Authors:

  - Xingyu Zhou

  - Feng Geng

- Absence:

  - Teacher Gu

  - Brother three

  - Ziyu Liu

- TL;DR  

  - matlab is bad, use c/cpp at least, or python as least

  - latex is bad, use RST where you can, or markdown at least.

  - qualcomm CPU is bad, use Intel where you can

- matebook-E-2019-qualcomm review:
  1. CPU is werid arm64 is not amd64. Many programs does not support arm64.
  1. You can use it as a big mobile phone, but expect to compile every program you wan to use on a desktop.


- mayavi moved to python3, use VTK as basis
- yaml is more human-friendly than html and json, should serve as a better format for writing blog/document. 
   - Microsoft Office suites uses XML to store its content. Word is providing a very good GUI/controller to allow easy manipulation of the underlying xml document.
   - The dragging action in WORD and PPT is indispensible. It will be hard to realise dragging by just using keyboard.

- Is conda worth it?
  - Not recommended for python starters. You need to have some prior knowledge to use it happily
  - installing conda took 30s?
  - installing deeptools took 30sec. Update took 30sec.
