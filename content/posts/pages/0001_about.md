Title: About Me
Date: 2016-11-25

### Overview

I am a computational biologist interested in applying machine learning to functional genomics datasets. Using Python2 as my primary language, I developed a expectation-maximisation program to auto-classify genes into synergistic groups.

I am also broadly interested in structural biology and molecular dynamics, including:

- cellular automata
- renormalisation / coarse-graining
- inverse-ising problem

On days outside coding, I spend my time playing music and building electronic devices. My favourite creation so far is a dispersive spectrometer.
