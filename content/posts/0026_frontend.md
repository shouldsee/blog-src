- Selecting the right package for the right purpose, read the best documentation, with the best speed.
  - chart.js / d3.js
  - handsontable.js

- XMLHttpRequest for making a request. Be careful with CORS restriction

- NCBI efetch, equery, elink interface as old perl endpoints... Better docs!
- BigQuery for NCBI SRA metadata is available on GCP.
- I have not found npm essential yet
- Mounting a sub-application in fastapi is still confusing. Manually managing prefix at the moment
  - auto-docstring is great!
- frps, frpc for content delivery
- Vultr instance is great!!

- Javascript is a very state-oriented and not object oriented. The restriction on scope and type is very weak. 
Checkout Typescript if time available

- github and git: making an auto PR is not easy! refs? heads? commit? branch? what is the difference?

- lesson from using a file system as database: don't trust the speed of a program that is not designed.

- lesson from hosting web applications: cloud ECs were not created equal:  1-vCPU != 1-vCPU 1GB!=1GB if on
different platform.

- web dev is impatient by nature.
