## What is life?

Is life about learning: No. Learning could be painful or rewarding. But life isnt about learning

Is life about indulgence: Some people say that, unleash all your desire and this is life. I dont think so. 子曰: 克己复礼

What is life about? You could learn how to live a life during your life, but this learning does not produce a definite procedure. Life is undefined and anything could happen.

Is life like a game? Some people say that, predict the move of the unknown, and play your move. 子曰: 当仁不让

Is life a number of choices? Not quite. Life consist of choices, but you cannot recover life from those choices. One choice lead to another, some paths open and others close.

## 韩非子-外储说左下

- 管仲相齐，
  - 曰：“臣贵矣，然而臣贫。”桓公曰：“使子有三归之家。”
  - 曰：“臣富矣，然而臣卑。”桓公使立于高、国之上。
  - 曰：“臣尊矣，然而臣疏。”乃立为仲父。

斯管仲之不贵,岂为桓公之过?管仲之命,其择可校乎?
